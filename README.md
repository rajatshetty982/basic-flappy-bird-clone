# Flappy Bird Clone


A simple Flappy Bird clone written in Lua with LÖVE2D.  
This is my 3rd project while learning game development,
This is from the Harvard's course CS50G, which is deprecated now thus, I can post it online without any worries. I hope.

## How to run
This is a very basic and untidy project, still for some reason you want to check it out then.

1. Install [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/).
2. Clone the repo
3. And just run in terminal
` love [project folder name] `
